# Adding ads.txt to squarespace 

This repo just hosts the ads.txt for their Adsense account.

It [is possible](https://www.graesen.com/blog/resolve-google-adsense-your-earnings-may-be-at-risk-error-for-squarespace) to upload the file to Squarespace, and then get the real url of the file, but it seems to change every few months.

So, we're hosting it on github.
